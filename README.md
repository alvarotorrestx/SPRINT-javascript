### Info
Name: Alvaro Torres - @alvarotorrestx
Changes: 
- Created Alert Overlay
- Created Alert Box
- Changed Alert game score message
- Added Play & Stop button on Alert
- Created styling for alert box, overlay
- Added pieces to script to display the alert
 - Added conditional statements to prevent game continuing in background
 - Added functions for buttons to work
- Each piece added/changed has comments on what the purpose is/was for
Apologies: I forgot to record pieces or entire pieces of me building the pieces, I did leave during the time of working on this, it slipped my mind.

### Issue
Instead of default browser alert make custom alert modals. #5
